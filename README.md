# B-Spline-Trajectory-Interpolation

This repository contains my MATLAB work on generating smooth motion trajectories for dynamic systems using both Polynomial and B-Spline interpolation techniques. The main objective of this project was to ensure continuous position, velocity, acceleration, and jerk profiles for precise and efficient motion control.

## Project Overview
The project focused on designing and comparing trajectory generation methods for robotic and automation systems.  
Using MATLAB, various motion profiles were created and analyzed to study their smoothness, responsiveness, and suitability for real-time applications.  
B-Spline interpolation was particularly explored due to its flexibility in maintaining continuity and reducing mechanical stress during motion transitions.

Key steps included:
- Implementation of Polynomial and B-Spline interpolation functions in MATLAB.
- Derivation of continuous position, velocity, acceleration, and jerk equations.
- Evaluation of trajectory smoothness and system stability under varying constraints.
- Visualization of motion profiles through MATLAB plots for comparative analysis.

## Tools and Technologies Used
MATLAB, Simulink, Curve Fitting Toolbox, and Numerical Analysis techniques.

## Project Outcome
The B-Spline interpolation method achieved smoother transitions and better control accuracy compared to traditional polynomial-based trajectories. The study highlighted its advantages for advanced motion systems, including robotics, CNC machines, and automated manufacturing setups.
